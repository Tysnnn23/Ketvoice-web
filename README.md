# Ketvoice Web

Official website for Ketvoice — an Android music player with Spotify lyrics.

## Release synchronization

Current app features exclude AutoMix. Stable Mobile/Quest downloads and English
release notes are read from `Tysnnn23/Ketvoice` on load, every minute while the
page is visible, and when returning to the tab. The banner is the canonical
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tysnnn23/Ketvoice/main/ketvoice-banner.png`.
Existing animations, live-listener integration and upstream changes are retained.

Ketvoice 3.11.0 adds continuous Canvas/lyrics control transitions, readable dark
action sheets, a charcoal dark theme, timed backing-vocal visibility and larger
artist portraits. Optional public-domain artist signatures and native 120 Hz
requests on compatible phones live in Appearance. 120 Hz is subject to Android
policy, not a measured 120 FPS guarantee; Quest keeps its own platform rate.
Signatures are opt-in with a normal-name fallback when unavailable. Automatic
update popups retain English notes and the release banner. Android still
requires installation confirmation. Older broken updaters may need one initial
GitHub install. Host/mock checks are not physical phone/Quest validation.

## Structure

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/style.css`, `css/dark.css` — styling and theme
- `js/main.js` — interactions, screen switcher, toast, download links
- `assets/` — spring physics, magnetic buttons, glass motion, theme toggle

## Run locally

```bash
npx serve .
```

Or use any static web server.

## Configuration

Edit `CONFIG` object in `index.html`:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  repo: 'Tysnnn23/Ketvoice',
  discordInvite: 'https://discord.gg/FyKjAXHvfY',
  activeListenersEndpoint: ''
};
```

The active-listeners endpoint (optional) should return `{ "activeListeners": <number> }`.

## Deploy
